# iframe-demo

A simple demo showing how to load external and local pages in tabs using `<iframe>`.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser and click one of the menu buttons. Each
button opens a new tab with an iframe. Tabs can be switched or closed with the
× button on each tab.

The menu includes:

- External sites like Example, Wikipedia, and Bing
- `Hello Page` – a static page served from this repo
- `Search Demo` – a small form that, upon submission, navigates to another page
  showing the form and mock results
